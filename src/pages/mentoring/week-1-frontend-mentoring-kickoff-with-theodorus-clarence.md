Had my first ever mentorship session, so curious about what kind of mentorship is it.

Theodorus Clarence, as far as I could remember, I knew him from Twitter Space at around end of 2021 and early 2022. Someone who has a deep interest in React ecosystem. That recently I discover that he was offered a job by a foreign startup, that the engineers are so spectacular. 

As the first mentorship session goes on, I would say that, it was so different compared to previous mentoring/bootcamp sessions I had. Mostly, there is a syllabus, a list of things that a mentee/student will be learn during the mentoring/bootcamp. But this mentorship is so much different, it gives you a concep to get started, and then the topic will be so dynamic depends on each student. It means that there are endless posibbilities, which might be what I’ve been looking for.

Learning React wasn’t in my option. In around 2018/2019 back then, that was an option of React, Vue, and Angular. React and Vue were the most used frontend frameworks at least for people around me. React was known for something that has its own learning curve, while Vue is something that easy and quick to learn. I decided to learn and use Vue, even my first job used Vue as its frontend stack.

But now I realized that market wants React. Market wants people who has been using React and faimiliar with its ecosystem, not just some person who just learn the documentation yesterday. React has a big community ecosystem, it means there are various libraries that you can use. As a beginner, it might give you a confusion towards which library you should pick for learning.

With this mentorship, I am happy that I don’t have to be confused about that. Because Clarence asked me to start working on the project with most basic React features without any external libraries. I had my courage and spirit to get started.

After explaining about the mentorship topic, there will be a QNA sessions. I asked bunch of things, including my background. Its really nice that Clarence is open to its mentee’s request. I wanted to build things as a preparation to apply a job and ease my frontend development. I asked Clarence if he could assist me or at least giving me feedback or resource to do that, and yes, he could help me with that.

I am not sure if I could finish it in a week, since I had other things to do. So, yeah, no worries, let’s get started anyway, focus one a thing first.
